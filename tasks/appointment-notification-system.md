## Technical Considerations

- Use Laravel's queue system for sending notifications asynchronously

## Frontend Implementation Details

### 1. Notification Preferences UI

**Components:**

- `NotificationPreferenceForm`: Main form component for managing preferences
- `ChannelToggle`: Toggle switch for each notification channel
- `ReminderTimeSelector`: Dropdown for selecting default reminder times

**User Flow:**

1. User navigates to Settings > Notifications
2. User toggles desired notification channels (email/browser)
3. User selects preferred reminder times
4. User saves preferences, which are stored in the database

### 2. In-App Notification Center

**Components:**

- `NotificationBell`: Header icon with unread count badge
- `NotificationDropdown`: Popover showing recent notifications
- `NotificationItem`: Individual notification with appointment details
- `NotificationList`: Full page view of all notifications
- `NotificationFilter`: Controls for filtering notification list

**User Flow:**

1. User sees notification count on bell icon
2. User clicks bell to view recent notifications
3. User can mark individual notifications as read
4. User can navigate to full notification list
5. User can filter/sort notifications and perform bulk actions

### 3. Browser Notifications

**Components:**

- `NotificationService`: Handles permission requests and notification display
- `ServiceWorker`: Background process for receiving push notifications
- `PermissionRequest`: UI for requesting notification permission

**User Flow:**

1. New user is prompted to enable browser notifications
2. When notifications are due, they appear as browser notifications
3. Clicking a notification opens the relevant appointment

### 4. Testing Strategy

For each component, we'll implement:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual component rendering and state
2. **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and API calls
3. **E2E Tests**: Test complete user flows

We'll follow a TDD approach by:

1. Writing tests first to define expected behavior
2. Implementing components to pass tests
3. Refactoring and optimizing while maintaining test coverage

## Completion Summary

✅ **Task Completed: August 2023**

The appointment notification system has been successfully implemented with all core features:

- **Backend**: Full notification service with scheduled tasks, controllers, and database models
- **Frontend**: Complete UI components for viewing and managing notifications
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for all notification components

The notification system includes:

- User preference management for notification channels and timing
- In-app notification center with read/unread status
- Email notification delivery
- Browser notification support

The only remaining enhancement is the implementation of a real-time notification system using WebSockets, which could be addressed in a future update as it's not critical for the core functionality.

All tests are passing, and the system is ready for production use.
